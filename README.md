# Snake
Classic Snake game made in Python3 using PyGame.

# Motivation
I wanted to experiment with PyGame and no better way to experiment than implementing something you're familiar with. Also, popular Youtube video by [Chris DeLeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs), where he codes Snake in 4 minutes 30 seconds, piqued my interest in finding out how fast I could do it. Definitely did not implement as fast as DeLeon did, but I was somewhere in the ballpark of ~2 hours.

# Installation
Before running this Snake game, some prerequisites:
1. Python3 
2. PyGame

## Python3
To install Python3 through the terminal, run the following:

`$ sudo apt-get update`

`$ sudo apt-get install python3.6`

For Windows, follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

## PyGame
To install Pygame through the terminal, use the following (skip to second line if PIP is already installed):

`$ sudo apt install python3-pip`

`$ pip3 install pygame`

Or you could go to the [PyGame website](https://www.pygame.org/news)
